## Preface


<h3>Purpose</h3>

This specification describes service endpoints, resources, functions and operations 
as well as details of requests and responses that interacts with an openEHR API in a RESTful manner.

This is not a specification of a REST API for openEHR Foundation services. 
It is rather an abstract blueprint to which each REST API of an openEHR implementation should adhere.

## Glossary and conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" 
in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

Types defined by openEHR specification are always capitalized (e.g. EHR, COMPOSITION, VERSIONED_OBJECT, etc.) when used in this specification. 
For a list of all available types or a particular type definition please refer to the [RM index](http://www.openehr.org/releases/RM/Release-1.0.3/docs/index#_class_index). 

Throughout this specification a set of short terms is being used as described below:

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
|`ehr_id`| The value for an EHR identifier, stored under EHR.ehr_id.value, usually an UUID or GUID |
|`versioned_object_uid`| The value of a VERSIONED_OBJECT unique identifier, stored under VERSIONED_OBJECT.uid.value, e.g. 8849182c-82ad-4088-a07f-48ead4180515 |
|`version_uid`| The  value of a VERSION unique identifier, stored under VERSION.uid.value, e.g. 8849182c-82ad-4088-a07f-48ead4180515::example.domain.com::1 |
|`object_id`| A placeholder for either `versioned_object_uid` or `version_uid` identifier |
|`timestamp`| A timestamp in the ISO8601 format (e.g. 2015-01-20T19:30:22.765+01:00) |

HTTP Methods used in this specification are described by [RFC 7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4).
HTTP Status codes are described by [RFC 7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6) 
and in the [IANA Status Code Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml).
See [Design considerations](#header-design-considerations) section for more details on how (in general) 
HTTP methods and status codes MUST be used by an openEHR REST API.  


## Design considerations


<h3>Authentication and authorization</h3>
::: note 
tbd  
:::


<h3>The `OPTIONS` method</h3> 
This method allows a client to determine the options and/or requirements associated with a
resource, or the capabilities of the service, without implying a resource action.
Services SHOULD respond to this method with at least appropriate HTTP codes and headers and potentially with a payload.
A usecase for this method is related to exposing service capabilities for an conformance manifest.  


<h3>The `commit-audit` headers</h3>
::: note 
tbd  
:::


<h3>The `If-Match` header</h3>
The use case of this is described by [RFC 7232](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232#section-3.1).
This HTTP header MUST be used by the clients to prevent accidental overwrites when multiple user
agents might be acting in parallel on the same resource. It MUST be used together with all 
request methods that are changing states or performing updates on a VERSIONED_OBJECT.
In case a service receives this header and the condition evaluates to `false` it MUST respond with
HTTP status code`412 Precondition Failed`.


<h3>The `Location` header</h3>
::: note 
tbd  
:::


<h3>The `ETag` header and cache handling and HEAD header</h3>
According to [RFC 7232](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232#section-2.3),

> The "ETag" header field in a response provides the current entity-tag
    for the selected representation, as determined at the conclusion of
    handling the request.  An entity-tag is an opaque validator for
    differentiating between multiple representations of the same
    resource, regardless of whether those multiple representations are
    due to resource state changes over time, content negotiation
    resulting in multiple representations being valid at the same time,
    or both.

This header SHOULD be present in all responses that contains full representation of VERSION, VERSIONED_OBJECT or Models
that have unique identifier for each of the state changed in time. The value of this header MAY be to the
unique identifier of that resource (e.g. VERSIONED_OBJECT.uid.value, VERSION.uid.value, EHR.ehr_id.value, etc).


<h3>HTTP status codes</h3>
To indicate the status of the request or the executed operation, one of the following 
subset of the HTTP status codes [RFC 7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6) MUST be used: 

| Code | Reason-Phrase          | Meaning, usecase and details                                                                                    |
|------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|       
|  200 | OK                     | The request succeeded, payload sent in a 200 response depends on the request method
|  201 | Created                | The request has been fulfilled and has resulted in one or more new resources being created
|  400 | Bad request            | The service cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error
|  401 | Unauthorized           | If the service requires authorization, this indicates that the request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource 
|  403 | Forbidden              | The service understood the request but refuses to authorize it
|  404 | Not found              | The origin service did not find the target resource or is not willing to disclose that one exists 
|  405 | Method Not Allowed     | The method received in the request-line is known by the origin service but not supported by the target resource 
|  406 | Not Acceptable         | The target resource does not have a current representation that would be acceptable to the user 
|  412 | Precondition Failed    | One or more conditions given in the request header fields evaluated to false when tested on the server
|  415 | Unsupported Media Type | The service is refusing the request because the payload is in a format not supported by this method on the target resource
|  500 | Internal Server Error  | The service encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request
|  501 | Not Implemented        | The service does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request

Meaning of these codes MAY be further detailed (nuanced) in this specification by particular responses
If required, other status codes MAY be used by implementations as long as their usecase is not conflicting or overlapping with above codes.   


## Data representation

Services SHOULD support at least one of the **XML** or **JSON** format for resource representation. 
See details below on how should this be negotiated.

<h3>XML Format</h3>

When resources representation is serialized as XML, the result MUST be valid against [published XSDs](http://www.openehr.org/releases/trunk/its/XML-schema/).

A client MAY use the header `Content-Type: application/xml` in the requests to specify the XML payload format. 
If the service cannot process the request payload as XML format is not supported, it MUST respond with HTTP status code`415 Unsupported Media Type`.

The `Accept: application/xml` SHOULD be used in the request by the client in order to specify the expected XML response format. 
If the service cannot fulfill this aspect of the request, it MUST respond with HTTP status code `406 Not Acceptable`.
Proper header `Content-Type: application/xml` MUST be present in the response of the service. 


<h3>JSON Format</h3>

Attribute names must be lowercase _snake_case_ names as specified in the RM specification for attributes. For example:
```
{"context": {"start_time": "2016-01-01T00:00Z"}}
```
Metadata attributes (those that are not also RM attributes) will always be prefixed by a `'_'`.
One example is the `_type` attribute, which should be used to specify the RM type whenever polymorphism is involved or the underlying definition in RM type is abstract.
The value of this attribute MUST be the uppercase class name from the RM specification. For example:
```
{
    "_type": "DV_TEXT",
    "value": "Hello world!"
}
```
The `Null` RM attributes SHOULD be absent when serialized as JSON.

::: note 
tbd json-schema 
:::

A client MAY use the header `Content-Type: application/json` in the requests to specify the JSON payload format. 
If the service cannot process the request payload as JSON format is not supported, it MUST respond with HTTP status code `415 Unsupported Media Type`.

The `Accept: application/json` SHOULD be used in the request by the client in order to specify the expected JSON response format. 
If the service cannot fulfill this aspect of the request, it MUST respond with HTTP status code `406 Not Acceptable`.
Proper header `Content-Type: application/json` MUST be present in the response of the service. 


<h3>Datetime format</h3>

Query parameters or timestamp path segments should always use the canonical ISO8601 expanded format, e.g. 2016-06-23T13:42:16.117+02:00.

Any date or datetime value provided by a create or update action inside the composition content 
will be preserved as it was sent (i.e. if composition was saved as narrow format, it will always return the way it was).


<h3>The `Prefer` header</h3>
When using the HTTP methods to create or update a resource the service SHOULD give the option of returning either a complete
representation of the (modified) resource or a minimal response that indicates only the successful completion of the operation.
See [RFC 7240](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7240#section-4.2) for more details.
The client MAY choose one option by using following HTTP header:
 - `Prefer: return=minimal` to inform the server that prefers only a minimal response to a successful request. 
 A `Location` header MUST be part of the response. This SHOULD be also default return policy in case no `Prefer` header is present in request.
 - `Prefer: return=representation` to inform the server that prefers a full representation response to a successful request.
 A `Location` header MAY be part of the response and the response SHOULD include a full representation. 

Another preference is related to following and resolving OBJ_REF identifiers. Under some circumstances a client 
MAY indicate that prefers response containing full or partial resource representation instead of references to resources using OBJ_REF.
A typical case is a list of COMPOSITIONs part of an EHR, which, strictly following RM specification, should always return 
list of OBJ_REF, but sometimes clients prefers to get COMPOSITIONs.
Services that have this capability implemented SHOULD accept and honor `Prefer: resolve_refs` request header.
